# 🏥 Health Insurance Analytics & Dashboard Project

This project explores a Health Insurance dataset using **R** for data cleaning & analysis and **Power BI** for dashboard visualizations.  
It demonstrates real-world data analytics skills for an entry-level data science portfolio.

## 📁 Project Structure


---

## 🧼 1. Data Cleaning (R)

The dataset was cleaned and prepared in **R**.  
Key cleaning steps include:

- Removing missing values  
- Creating new variables:
  - **age_group**
  - **bmi_category**
- Renaming columns for consistency  
- Saving final dataset as **insurance_clean.csv**

## 🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA in R)

The R script generates important insights:

### ✔ Average charges by smoker vs non-smoker  
### ✔ Scatterplot: BMI vs Charges  
### ✔ Boxplot: Charges by Region  
### ✔ Correlation heatmap for numerical variables  

These visualizations help identify:

- the impact of smoking on insurance charges  
- BMI patterns  
- regional cost variations  
- relationships between age, BMI, charges, and children  

Screenshots of R outputs are stored in the **screenshots** folder.

## 📊 3. Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- **Risk Score by BMI Category**  
- **BMI by Sex**  
- **Smoker Distribution**  
- **Age Group vs BMI**  
- **Smoker Count by Region**  
- **Average Charges Visuals**  
- **Filters (Age Group, Region, Smoking Status)**  

These visuals allow users to interactively explore insurance cost drivers.

Screenshots are included under **/screenshots**.
